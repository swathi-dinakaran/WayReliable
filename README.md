Way Reliable
==============================

An ML model with user interface, to provide probability of certain crime occuring at any given time and date in future.     
The user interacts with the spatial map of the area(eg: Raleigh) to analyse the heatmap color coded with the probability of risk.    
This enables the user to avoids certains areas at certain points of the day, where their likelihood of becoming victims of a particular type of crime are higher.
